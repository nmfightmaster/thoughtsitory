# Thoughtsitory

**Thoughtsitory** is a new kind of thinking tool — a version-controlled, modular, and persistent system for structured collaboration between humans and AI. It treats thought like code: modular, branchable, and trackable over time.

Instead of working in a single, sprawling conversation with an AI, Thoughtsitory breaks complex projects into manageable, scoped "ThoughtNodes" that can evolve independently or together. You can fork, merge, version, and revisit ideas just like you would in a Git repository — but for thoughts.

## What is a Thoughtsitory?

A **thoughtsitory** is a structured collection of interconnected ThoughtNodes. It represents a project, a line of inquiry, or an entire creative endeavor.

- A **ThoughtNode** is a versioned conversation with scope.
- Nodes are connected hierarchically or as a graph.
- Nodes can be forked to explore alternatives without polluting the original.
- Versions are tracked, and summaries are persisted over time.
- The structure makes it easy to navigate, revisit, and expand complex thinking.

## Core Features

- **Scoped Thinking**: Keep each conversation narrowly focused, making AI assistance more coherent and manageable.
- **Version Control**: Track the evolution of ideas through versioned updates to each node.
- **Forking and Branching**: Explore alternative ideas or directions without losing your original thread.
- **Merging**: Bring together insights from different nodes or branches into a unified idea.
- **Summarization**: Each node carries an up-to-date summary of its current state, maintained by the AI or the user.
- **Graph-Based Navigation**: Traverse your thoughts by topic, dependency, or chronology.

## Why Use Thoughtsitory?

Modern AI tools are optimized for short-term tasks and lack memory across sessions or structure within them. Thoughtsitory addresses this gap by introducing:

- Persistent, queryable memory across scoped conversations
- An intentional structure for large, evolving projects
- A system that encourages clean, composable ideation
- The ability to work with AI more like a collaborator than a notepad

This makes it ideal for:

- Game design and creative development
- Research and thesis planning
- Product and software design
- Worldbuilding and storytelling
- Strategic planning and business modeling
- Personal knowledge management

## Project Status

Thoughtsitory is currently in early development. The initial goal is to build a minimal prototype with:

- CLI-based thoughtsitory and node management
- Basic file persistence
- Support for forking, merging, and summarizing ThoughtNodes
- Integration with an LLM API for generating responses and summaries

## Roadmap

- ThoughtNode data model and file structure
- CLI for creating, viewing, and navigating thoughtsitories
- Version control (manual and automatic)
- Scope shift detection and suggestion to fork
- Visual representation (graph view)
- AI integrations (OpenAI, Claude, local models)
- Syncing across devices or teams

## Philosophy

Thoughtsitory treats ideation as a first-class artifact — something worth managing, exploring, and revising intentionally. It's not just a note-taking app, not just an AI wrapper, and not a social platform. It's a system for long-term, deep work with AI.
